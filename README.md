# Clip Beam

> Under active development.

Clip Beam is a web application that lets you share files and text easily between two devices.

Simply connect two devices by scanning a QR code and start sharing data.

Inspired by common messaging app web clients like Treema Web and [SnapDrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop).
